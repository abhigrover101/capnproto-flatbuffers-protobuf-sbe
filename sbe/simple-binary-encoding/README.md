[SBE](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/file/fplpo/read/1196757/simple-binary-encoding-release-candidate-2) is 
OSI layer 6 presentation for encoding and decoding application messages in binary format for low-latency applications.

Further details on the background and usage of SBE can be found on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki).

Benchmark tools and information can be found [here](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/tree/master/perf)
and run from he root perf-build.xml file.

Build
-----

Full clean build:

    $ ./gradlew

Run the Java examples

    $ ./gradlew runJavaExamples

Distribution
------------

Jars for the executable, source, and javadoc can be found in

    build/libs

Android Build
-------------

In order to build the android binaries you need to run the android:dist target 

    $ ant android:dist

As a prerequisite, you need Android SDK to be installed and the path needs to be configured inside `build-local.properties` file. 
You need at least Android target 19 (it comes with Java 7 support) and Android build tools version at least 20.0.0. E.g. 

    android.sdk.dir=/opt/android-sdk-linux
    android.target=android-19
    android.build.tools.version=20.0.0

Android jars for the codec, source, and javadoc can be found in

    target/dist

C++ Build using CMake
---------------------

NOTE: Linux, Mac OS, and Windows only for the moment. See
[FAQ](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).
Windows builds have been tested with Visual Studio Express 12.

First build using gradle to generate the SBE jar.

    $ ./gradlew

Then build and test with CMake __in the build subdirectory created by the gradle build__.

    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build .
    $ ctest

C# Build
--------

See [README.md](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/tree/master/vs2013) in vs2013 directory


Python Support
--------------

See [README.md](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/tree/master/examples/python) in python directory.
